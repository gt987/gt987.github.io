title: "Cabs vs Uber"
---

Since the introduction of the iPhone, our lives and habits have changed dramatically, and one of these big changes involves the way we travel around cities. For example, 10 years ago we used to raise our arm to call a cab, nowadays we most likely go for our phones, and probably in some years we'll summon a driverless car using our watch. Moreover, all these changes are also affecting companies that haven't been able to evolve (think about Nokia) and entire compartments of the economy (sorry drivers...).

In this post I will take a look at the traditional cab companies operating in NYC and see how they are doing in the era of Uber. Are they doing well or just dying slowly? To answer these kind of questions I used the data of the The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) which has made publicly available a [gigantic database](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) of all the rides of the Yellow, Green and FHV (For Hire Vehicle) companies in NYC from 2009 to present.

This database can obviously answer a bunch of interesting questions and should be exploited much more than what I will be showing here. To mention some possible direction:
* When and Where should vehicles stay to maximize total income?
* How bad is rush hour?
* Is it better to take a cab or a city bike or the metro?
* Are you tipping too few?
* ...
