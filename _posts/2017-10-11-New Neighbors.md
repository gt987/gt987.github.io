title: "New Neighbors"
---

I have new neighbors... noisy neighbors! I had noticed that new people were living above my apartment, and I was of course fine with that... until the past weekend, when I woke up at 3 am because of the loud music and pounding on the floor. But hey, I live in NYC, the city that never sleeps. Or at least this is what I thought. (Okay, maybe not the first thing that I thought...)

But is this even true? Are really people in NYC used to noise? Or in other words:
* when does typically people start to complain about noise?
* which are the most noise areas in NYC?

To find an answer to these questions, I have taken a look at the enormous database of calls to the 311

The database contains...

## Is it too early to call 311?

I pulled from the database 10^5 calls that where categorized as "residential noise". Interestingly enough, most of the time people complains for their neighbors having loud music and dancing (70%), and sometimes for pounding (25%). Take a look

But the most important question for my future good rest is when do people start to call the police?
This brings me to the distribution of calls over time. As expected most calls happen at night, but to my surprise, as early as 9 pm with a peak at 11 pm.
