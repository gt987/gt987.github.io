title: "New Neighbors"
---

I have new neighbors... noisy neighbors! It was just a couple of weeks ago that I noticed new people living above my apartment, and I was ofc fine with that... until this weekend, when I woke up at 3 am because of the loud music and pounding on the floor. But hey, I live in NYC, the city that never sleeps. Or at least this is what I thought. (Okay maybe not the first thing that I thought...)

But is this even true? Are really people in NYC used to noise? Or in other words:

* when does typically people start to complain about noise?
* which are the most noise areas in NYC?
