I have new neighbors... noisy neighbors! I had noticed that new people were living above my apartment, and I was of course fine with that... until the past weekend, when I woke up at 3 am because of the loud music and pounding on the floor. But hey, I live in NYC, the city that never sleeps. Or at least this is what I thought. (Okay, maybe not the first thing that I thought...)

But is this even true? Are really people in NYC used to noise? Or in other words:
* when does typically people start to complain about noise?
* which are the most noise areas in NYC?

To find an answer to these questions, I have taken a look at the enormous database of calls to the 311
